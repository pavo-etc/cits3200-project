<h2>
<b>1.0 General Goals</b></h2>
For this section, enter the goals of your subsystem, i.e. what are the
objectives of the functions of your subsystem?<br>
<h2>
<b>2.0 Current System</b></h2>
For this section, describe the current situation that is relevant to your
subsystem.<br>
<h2>
<b>3.0 Proposed System</b></h2>
For this section, describe the proposed solution (i.e. your subsystem)
under the following headings.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>3.1 Overview</b><br>
<BR>
<br>For this section, give a top-level description of your subsystem.<br>
<br>
<b>3.2 Functional Requirements<br>
</b>For this section, list out the functional requirements of your subsystem.<br>
<br>
<b>3.3 Nonfunctional Requirements<br>
</b>For this section, list out the non-functional requirements of your
subsystems in the following headings.
<h4>
3.3.1 User Interface and Human Factors</h4>
For this section, you will have to think about the interaction between
the potential users and your subsystem. Consider the following:
<br><font color="#008000">What type of user will be using the system (expert,
novice, etc.) ? Will more than one type of user be using the system? What
sort of training will be required for each type of user? Is it particularly
important that the system be easy to learn? Is it particularly important
that users be protected from making errors? What sort of input/output devices
for the human interface are available, and what are their characteristics?</font>
<br>
<h4>
3.3.2 Documentation</h4>
For this section, focus on your plans for future subsystem documents. Consider
the following:
<br><font color="#008000">What kind of documentation is required? What
audience is to be addressed by each document?</font>
<br>
<h4>
3.3.3 Hardware Consideration</h4>
For this section, think about the hardware issues that your subsystem will
be facing. Consider the following:
<br><font color="#008000">What hardware is the proposed system to be used
on? What are the characteristics of the target hardware, including memory
size and auxiliary storage space?</font>
<br>
<h4>
3.3.4 Performance Characteristics</h4>
For this section, consider the performance requirements and limitations
of your subsystem. Consider the following:
<br><font color="#008000">Are there any speed, throughput, or response
time constraints on the system? Are there size or capacity constraints
on the data to be processed by the system?</font>
<br>
<h4>
3.3.5 Error Handling and Extreme Conditions</h4>
For this section, focus on the possible error occurrences and how your
subsytem will deal with them. Consider the following:
<br><font color="#008000">How should the system respond to input errors?
How should the system respond to extreme conditions?</font>
<br>
<h4>
3.3.6 System Interfacing</h4>
For this section, think about the I/O of your subsystem. Consider the following:
<br><font color="#008000">Is input coming from systems outside the proposed
system? Is output going to systems outside the proposed system? Are there
restrictions on the format or medium that must be used for input or output?</font>
<br>
<h4>
3.3.7 Quality Issues</h4>
For this section, focus on the possible quality enhancement or compromises.
Consider the following:
<br><font color="#008000">What are the requirements for reliability? Must
the system trap faults? Is there a maximum acceptable time for restarting
the system after a failure? What is the acceptable system downtime per
24-hour period? Is it important that the system be portable (able to move
to different hardware or operating system environments)?</font>
<br>
<h4>
3.3.8 System Modifications</h4>
For this section, think about the current infrastructure of your system
which will be extended for future features, incorporated or made obsolete.
Consider the following:
<br><font color="#008000">What parts of the system are likely candidates
for later modification? What sorts of modifications are expected?</font>
<br>
<h4>
3.3.9 Physical Environment</h4>
For this section, consider the physical environment in which your susbsystem
will exist. Consider the following:
<br><font color="#008000">Where will the target equipment operate? Will
the target equipment be in one or several locations? Will the environmental
conditions in any way be out of the ordinary (for example, unusual temperatures,
vibrations, magnetic fields, ...)?</font>
<br>
<h4>
3.3.10 Security Issues</h4>
For this section, Focus on all possible security considerations. Consider
the following:
<br><font color="#008000">Must access to any data or the system itself
be controlled? Is physical security an issue?</font>
<br>
<h4>
3.3.11 Resource Issues</h4>
For this section, think about data management for your subsystem. Consider
the following:
<br><font color="#008000">How often will the system be backed up? Who will
be responsible for the back up? Who is responsible for system installation?
Who will be responsible for system maintenance?</font>
<br>
. 
<h3>
3.4 Constraints</h3>
For this section, consider all the limitations imposed on your subsystem.
Consider the following:
<br><font color="#008000">Constraints on the programming language. Constraints
on the development environment. Constraints on the use of libraries. Constraints
on the use of legacy systems.</font>
<br>
<h3>
3.5 System Model</h3>
You will have to use the UML (Unified Modelling Language) to create the models. 
If the CASE tools is not installed yet (Together-J), you can use Visio or Powerpoint 
to produce the models. For more information on the notations of UML, check out 
the following Rational websites - <a href="https://www.rational.com/uml/html/notation/" target="_blank">Notation</a> 
and <a href="https://www.rational.com/uml/documentation.html/" target="_blank">Documentation</a>. 
To make your models more readable, you have to include some texts to guide the 
reader along the flow of your model. These text are called Navigational Text because 
they help to move the reader along the models. 
<h4>
3.5.1 Scenarios</h4>
For this section, think about all the possible ways which the users will
interact with your subsystem. Present them in a "story" format.
<br>
<h4>
3.5.2 Use Case Models</h4>
3.5.2.1 Actors <br>
3.5.2.2 Use Cases
<h4>
3.5.3 Object Models</h4>
3.5.3.1 Data Dictionary <br>
3.5.3.2 Class Diagrams
<h4>
3.5.4 Dynamic Models</h4>
<h4>
3.5.5 User Interface - Navigational Paths and Screen Mockups</h4>
